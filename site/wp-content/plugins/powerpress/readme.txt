== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Compatible Themes and Plugins =
Most themes and plugins are compatible with PowerPress. PowerPress is developed and tested using the default themes packaged with WordPress including twentyten, twentytwelve, twentythirteen, twentyfourteen, twentyfifteen, and all future versions. These themes use WordPress best practices and adhere to theme rules set by WordPress.org. Any child theme based on these themes should also work without issue.

If you are having a problem, try [Diagnosing Feed and/or Player Issues](http://create.blubrry.com/resources/powerpress/using-powerpress/diagnosing-feed-andor-player-issues-with-powerpress/).

If you are having a problem specifically with the player and links, try the "Having issues?" option under PowerPress Settings > Appearance tab. Visit [Resolving Plugin or Theme Conflicts](http://create.blubrry.com/resources/powerpress/powerpress-settings/media-appearance/plugin-theme-conflict-issues/) for details.

= Premium themes compatible with PowerPress =
[Appendipity Podcast Pro theme](https://www.appendipity.com/themes/podcast-pro-theme/?aid=13) is is designed specifically to take advantage of built-in features, settings and podcast episode meta data in PowerPress. The Blubrry team works with the Appendipity team during beta testing and major WordPress releases to make sure the Podcast Pro theme and PowerPress work together seamlessly.


 = Related Plugins =
 The following plugins may be used in conjunction with PowerPress.

 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress support multiple enclosures in one feed item/post? =
Blubrry PowerPress does not allow you to include multiple media files for one feed item (blog post). This is because each podcatcher handles multiple enclosures in feeds differently. iTunes will download the first enclosure that it sees in the feed ignoring the rest. Other podcatchers and podcasting directories either pick up the first enclosure or the last in each post item. This inconsistency combined with the fact that [Dave Winer does not recommend multiple enclosures](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2004/12/21) and the [FeedValidator.org recommendation against it](http://www.feedvalidator.org/docs/warning/DuplicateEnclosure.html) is why the Blubrry PowerPress does not support them.

As a alternative, PowerPress allows you to create additional Custom Podcast Feeds to associate any magnitude of media format and/or length in a blog post to specific custom feeds. For example, you can create one blog post associated to separate video and audio podcast feeds saving you time from entering your show notes twice. 

 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress include media statistics built-in? =
 Blubrry PowerPress does not include media statistics built-in. This is not because Blubrry has its own statistics service, although that's a good reason by itself. Maintaining and calculating statistics is a resource and server intensive task that would add bloat to an otherwise efficient WordPress podcasting plugin. We recommend using your media hosting's web statistics to give you basic download numbers and, if you are seeking more grandular measurements such as client and geographical information for each episode, you're more than welcome to use the [Blubrry Statistics service](http://create.blubrry.com/resources/podcast-media-download-statistics/) as well.
 
 You may however access your Blubrry Statistics from within your WordPress dashboard.
 
 = How do you insert the player within a blog post? =
You can insert the media player within your blog posts by using the WordPress shortcode feature. The shortcode for PowerPress is `[powerpress]` (all lowercase)

 You may use the shortcode to add a player to other media files (non episode files) by specifying the media url in the shortcode: [powerpress url="http://example.com/path/to/media.mp3"]
	
 For advanced users with multiple podcast feeds, you may insert the player for a specific feed by specifying the feed slug in the shortcode: [powerpress feed="podcast"]
 
 If you want to specify a cover image, add an image attribute which points to the specific image url: [powerpress image="http://example.com/path/to/cover_image.jpg"] *Experimental*
	
 = Why can't you upload large media files? =
 File uploads are tricky to handle because there are so many web hosting variations with different upload size limits. We recommend using an FTP application to upload large media files. FTP is much more efficient than web based uploads and is typically provided by nearly all web hosting providers.

  = The Media Player does not appear on my site? =
. . . or the RSS feed is invalid?

This can happen when there is a theme or plugin conflict. Please visit our [Diagnosing Feed and/or Player Issues](http://create.blubrry.com/resources/powerpress/using-powerpress/diagnosing-feed-andor-player-issues-with-powerpress/) for instructions how to resolve such issues.

= 5.0.4 =
* Released on 1/30/2014
* Fixed bug with MEjs player not working for m4a files (Thanks JT for the code patch!)
* Added logic to PowerPress edit iTunes Subscription URL settings, precaution to make sure the field is saved correctly.
* Made a few CSS changes for WordPress 3.8+

* Removed `PHP_EOL` from powerpress-player.php where the player links are added to the post content. This should solve the issue where some themes or plugins replace new line characters with actual `<br/>` tags. (Thanks Nathan for the fix!)
* Option to remove statistics from Dashboard has been re-added. 5.0/5.0.1 removed the option which was automatically disabling statistics in dashboard. Our mistake!

= 5.0.1 = 
* Released on 08/30/2013
* Removed debug alert box from PowerPress mejs file, only occurred in IE and Safari browsers

= 5.0 =
* Released on 08/27/2013
* Advanced Mode added (Was an old feature in PowerPress 1.0 that was removed since 2.0, now it's back!)
* Default Mode with 3 Simple Steps added!
* Taxonomy Podcasting added (feature sponsored by [AfterBuzzTV.com](http://afterbuzztv.com/))

* Fixed bug where settings saved message did not always appear at the top of the pages.
* Added define `POWERPRESS_NO_PODCAST_FEED`, if set to true in wp-config, PowerPress will not add the default podcast feed with slug name 'podcast'. For users who exclusively want a page or category called 'podcast'. NOTE: There will be no podcast only feed provided by default when this define is set, use at your own risk.
* iTunes and RSS image settings moved to "Artwork" tab.
* New iTunes Episode image option added to both the Artwork tab as well as the Episode Entry Box (Thanks Robin Brinkler and Daniel Lewis for suggesting the features)
* jQuery based watermark replaced with HTML5 placeholder values, the jquery.watermark.js is no longer packaged with PowerPress.
* Fixed bug with *Feed Episode Maximizer* RSS <description> having the invalid characters when used with WordPRess 3.6.
* *Feed Episode Maximizer* is no longer experimental, we've successfully used the feature on a number of podcasts without issue for over a year now.
* Player width for audio and video can now use a percentage, ideal for resposive sites.
* player.js script is now always enqueued with other WordPress scripts. If you have player issues, please update your theme!
* Added link to settings from the plugins management screen, should help folks who are new to PowerPress find settings quickly.


= 4.0.9 =
* Releaesd on 6/20/2013
* PowerPress 5.0 is coming! If you would like to beta test, please contact Angelo at cio [at] rawovice dot com. Beta testing starts when WordPress 3.6 is released, PowerPress 5.0 will utilize some new features in WordPress 3.6.
* The PowerPress Version Updates Survey results will be posted in the coming weeks.  Based on user feedback, we will release minor updates within 7 days if necessary, major releases between 1-3 months apart, and new features will be included in the plugin but disabled by default.
* Fixed logic for displaying statistics in dashboard to time out after 1 second (was previously 15 seconds) so if there's a network issue between the server and blubrry.com the dashboard still loads promptly. (Thanks Michael Hansen for bringing to our attention!)
* Added new filter `powerpress_feed_auth` for other plugins to filter feed authentication. (Thanks amereservant for the feature suggestion!)
* Added new define `POWERPRESS_AUTO_DETECT_ONCE`, edits to existing episodes will use the specify option if this define is set to true. (Thanks amereservant for the feature suggestion!)
* Fixed bug with ID3 tagging not correctly incrementing the track number for episodes. This only affected Blubrry hosting customers who had this option turned on. (Thanks RWPeck for bringing to our attention!)
* Mobile devices now use the same HTML5 player as the regular desktop HTML5 player found in PowerPress. This is due to reports that some mobile devices are now pre-loading media on pages, this will cut down on such bandwidth. (Thanks Daniel for bringing to our attention)
* Added new define `POWERPRESS_POST_TYPES`, when set, only the post types specified are given podcasting episode entry boxes. Multiple post types are separated by commas. Example with added movies custom post type added: `'page,post,movies'`. This will bypass the default behavior of adding episode boxes to all post types with `post` or `page` capability.
* Fixed bug with unchecking iTunes Closed Captioned option not saving. (Thanks davidcross for reporting bug)
